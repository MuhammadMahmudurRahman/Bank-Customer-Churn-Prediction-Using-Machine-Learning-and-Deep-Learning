# AI Project
## Bank Customer Churn Prediction
This project employs an AI-driven approach to predict customer churn for banking institutions by analyzing customer demographics and financial data. The goal is to assess the risk of customer churn by evaluating various factors such as credit score, account balance, and customer activity. By leveraging machine learning and deep learning models, the project aims to provide valuable insights into customer behavior, enabling banks to take proactive measures to retain at-risk customers.

## Key Features:
• Data Analysis: Comprehensive examination of customer demographics and financial data to identify patterns and trends associated with churn.

• Model Implementation: Deployment of advanced machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), alongside a deep learning model to predict churn with high accuracy.

• Feature Importance: Use of techniques like Permutation Feature Importance to determine the impact of individual features on model predictions.

• Visualization: Detailed visualizations, including KS Test distributions, age bins, and balance bins, to provide a clear understanding of factors influencing churn.

• Deployment: Integration with Streamlit for an interactive and user-friendly interface, allowing stakeholders to explore model predictions and insights easily.

## Outcomes:
• Identification of critical factors affecting customer retention, such as credit score, account balance, and length of customer relationship.

• Enhanced understanding of customer behavior through detailed feature importance analysis and visualizations.

• Provision of actionable insights to banking institutions to support strategic decision-making and improve customer retention strategies.

## Future Enhancements:
• Exploration of more advanced models, such as ensemble techniques, to further improve prediction accuracy.

• Regular updates with new data to maintain and enhance model performance.

• Expansion of the project to include additional customer metrics and financial indicators.


##### This project underscores the potential of AI and machine learning in transforming customer retention strategies within the banking sector by offering deep insights and effective tools to manage customer relationships.
